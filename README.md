# Basic-Python-Calculator
This is my first Python project â€” a basic command-line calculator. It performs simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I built it to learn Python basics such as variables, user input, conditionals, and error handling. It also handles cases like division by zero and invalid operators.
